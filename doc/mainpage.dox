\section secIntro Introduction

LSST C++ exceptions are designed to automatically provide information about
where the exception was thrown from.  Exception subclasses can be defined to
more precisely delineate their causes.  Context information can be provided
through a simple message or, in rare cases, additional instance variables
within exception subclasses; caught and rethrown exceptions can have additional
context information appended.

\section secPython Python Interface

Python wrappers for the C++ exception objects are generated using SWIG.  Any
package defining new exception subclasses must import
lsst/pex/exceptions/exceptionsLib.i in its SWIG configuration, as well as
including the exception subclass header file.

The new SWIGged exception class derives from the lsst.pex.exceptions.Exception
class but will not derive from the Python Exception base class. Instead,
exceptions deriving from this Exception class are caught (in p_lsstSwig.i) and
transformed into lsst.pex.exceptions.LsstCppException instances. The
LsstCppException class derives from LsstException (usable by Python code),
which in turn derives from the Python Exception base class. The SWIG proxy for
the customized exception class is accessible as the args[0] item in the
LsstCppException.

Other exceptions thrown from C++ are raised as Python RuntimeErrors. No attempt
is made to move the C++ traceback information into a Python traceback object. 

None of the exceptions defined in this package should be used from Python code.
Pure Python exceptions should be used, either deriving from the normal Python
Exception base class or, if needed, the lsst.pex.exceptions.LsstException base
class.
